  <h1 class="page-title">Howard Zinn – A people's History of the United States</h1>
</header>
<div class="content">
  <h2 id="tyranny-is-tyrrany">“Tyranny is tyrrany”</h2>

<p>When the Declaration of Independence was read, with all its flaming radical language, from the town hall balcony in Boston, it was read by Thomas Crafts, a member of the Loyal Nine group, conservatives who had opposed militant action against the British. Four days after the reading, the Boston Committee of Correspondence ordered the townsmen to show up on the Common for a military draft. The rich, it turned out, could avoid the draft by paying for substitutes; the poor had to serve. This led to rioting, and shouting: “Tyranny is Tyranny let it come from whom it may.”</p>

<h2 id="racial-prejudice-and-the-constitution">Racial prejudice and the Constitution</h2>

<p>Banneker asked Jefferson<label for="sn-id-jefferson" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-jefferson" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Thomas Jefferson (1743 – 1826), statesman, diplomat, lawyer, architect, philosopher, Founding Father, 3<sup>rd</sup> president of the US. </span> “to wean yourselves from those narrow prejudices which you have imbibed.”</p>

<p>Jefferson tried his best, as an enlightened, thoughtful individual might. But the structure of American  society,  the  power  of  the  cotton  plantation,  the  slave  trade,  the  politics  of  unity  between northern and southern elites, and the long culture of race prejudice in the colonies, as  well  as  his  own  weaknesses – that  combination  of  practical  need  and  ideological  fixation – kept Jefferson a slaveowner throughout his life.</p>

<p>The   inferior   position   of   blacks,   the   exclusion   of   Indians   from   the   new   society,   the   establishment of supremacy for the rich and powerful in the new nation – all this was already settled in the colonies by the time of the Revolution. With the English out of the way, it could now  be  put  on  paper,  solidified,  regularized,  made  legitimate,  by  the  Constitution  of  the  United States, drafted at a convention of Revolutionary leaders in Philadelphia<label for="sn-id-date" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-date" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">In 1787 </span>.</p>

<h2 id="quoting-hamilton-on-the-structure-of-government">Quoting Hamilton on the structure of government</h2>

<p>Alexander  Hamilton<label for="sn-id-hamilton" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-hamilton" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Alexander Hamilton (1757 – 1804), statesman, politician, legal scholar, military commander, lawyer, banker, and economist.  Founding Father. </span>,  aide  to  Washington  during  the  war,  was  one  of  the  most  forceful  and  astute leaders of the new aristocracy. He voiced his political philosophy:</p>

<p>“All  communities  divide  themselves  into  the  few  and  the  many.  The  first  are  the  rich  and  well-born,  the  other  the  mass  of  the  people.  The  voice  of  the  people  has  been  said  to  be  the  voice of God; and however generally this maxim has been quoted and believed, it is not true in  fact.  The  people  are  turbulent  and  changing;  they  seldom  judge  or  determine  right.  Give  therefore  to  the  first  class  <strong>a  distinct  permanent  share  in  the  government</strong>. Can  a  democratic assembly who annually revolve in the mass of the people be supposed steadily to pursue  the  public  good?  Nothing  but  a  permanent  body  can  check  the  imprudence  of  democracy […].”</p>

<h2 id="on-the-constitution-and-economic-interest">On the Constitution and economic interest</h2>

<p>As  part  of  his  argument  for  a  large  republic  to  keep  the  peace,  James  Madison<label for="sn-id-madison" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-madison" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">James Madison Jr. (1751 – 1836), statesman, diplomat, philosopher, Founding Father, 4<sup>th</sup> president of the US from 1809 to 1817. </span> tells  quite  clearly […]  whose  peace  he  wants  to  keep: “A  rage  for  paper  money,  for  an  abolition  of  debts,  for  an  equal  division  of  property,  or  for  any  other  improper  or  wicked  project, will be less apt to pervade the whole body of the Union than a particular member of it.»</p>

<p>When  economic  interest  is  seen  behind  the  political  clauses  of  the  Constitution,  then  the  document becomes not simply the work of wise men trying to establish a decent and orderly society, but the work of certain groups trying to maintain their privileges, while giving just enough rights and liberties to enough of the people to ensure popular support.</p>

<h2 id="the-ballot-game">The ballot game</h2>

<p>When Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, ran for President in 1884, the general impression in the country was that he opposed the power of monopolies and corporations, and that the Republican party […] stood for the wealthy. But when Cleveland [won], Jay Gould wired him: “I feel […] that the vast business interests of the country will be entirely safe in your hands.” And he was right.</p>

<p>[…]   Cleveland himself assured industrialists that his election should not frighten them: “No harm shall come to any business interest as the result ofadministrative policy so long as I am President … a transfer of executive control from one party to another does not mean any serious disturbance of existing conditions.”</p>

<p>The presidential election itself had avoided real issues […]. It took the
usual form of election campaigns, concealing the basic similarity of the parties by dwelling on
personalities, gossip, trivialities. Henry Adams, an astute literary commentator on that era,
wrote to a friend about the election:</p>

<p>“We are here plunged in politics funnier than words can express. Very great issues are
involved.. . . But the amusing thing is that no one talks about real interests. By common
consent they agree to let these alone. We are afraid to discuss them. Instead of this the press
is engaged in a most amusing dispute whether Mr. Cleveland had an illegitimate child and
did or did not live with more than one mistress.”</p>

<h2 id="henry-cabot-lodge-us-foreign-policy-and-the-advancement-of-western-civilization--us-foreign-policy">Henry Cabot Lodge, US foreign policy, and the advancement of Western Civilization // US foreign policy</h2>

<p>Senator Henry Cabot Lodge<label for="sn-id-lodge" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-lodge" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Henry Cabot Lodge (1850 – 1924), Republican senator and historian. Close friend of Theodore Roosevelt. </span> of Massachusetts wrote in a magazine article:
“In the interests of our commerce … we should build the Nicaragua canal, and for the
protection of that canal and for the sake of our commercial supremacy in the Pacific we should control the Hawaiian islands and maintain our influence in Samoa […] and when the
Nicaraguan canal is built, the island of Cuba  […]  will become a necessity […]. The great nations
are rapidly absorbing for their future expansion and their present defense all the waste
places of the earth. It is a movement which makes for civilization and the advancement of
the race. As one of the great nations of the world the United States must not fall out of the
line of march.”</p>

<h2 id="theodore-roosevelt-and-the-war">Theodore Roosevelt and the war</h2>

<p>Theodore Roosevelt<label for="sn-id-roosevelt" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-roosevelt" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Theodore Roosevelt Jr. (1858 – 1919), statesman, politician, conservationist, naturalist, 26<sup>th</sup> president of the US from 1901 to 1909. </span> wrote to a friend in the year 1897: “In strict confidence […] I should welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs one.”</p>

<h2 id="the-end-of-world-war-ii">The End of World War II</h2>

<p>True, the war then ended quickly. Italy had been defeated a year earlier. Germany had recently surrendered, crushed primarily by the armies of the Soviet Union on the Eastern
Front, aided by the Allied armies on the West. Now Japan surrendered. The Fascist powers
were destroyed.</p>

<p>But what about fascism – as idea, as reality? Were its essential elements – militarism, racism, imperialism – now gone? Or were they absorbed into the already poisoned bones of the victors?
A. J. Muste, the revolutionary pacifist, had predicted in 1941: “<strong>The problem after a war is with the victor</strong>. He thinks he has just proved that war and violence pay. Who will now teach him a lesson?”</p>

<h2 id="plea-bargaining">Plea bargaining</h2>

<p>Most of the Attica prisoners were there as a result of plea bargaining. Of 32,000 felony
indictments a year in New York State, 4,000 to 5,000 were tried. The rest (about 75 percent)
were disposed of by deals made under duress, called <em>plea bargaining</em>, described as follows
in the Report of the Joint Legislative Committee on Crime in New York:</p>

<p>“The final climactic act in the plea bargaining procedure is a charade which in itself has
aspects of dishonesty which rival the original crime in many instances. The accused is made
to assert publicly his guilt on a specific crime, which in many cases he has not committed; in
some cases he pleads guilty to a non-existing crime. He must further indicate that he is
entering his plea freely […], and that he is not doing so because of any promises […] made to him.</p>

<p>In plea bargaining, the accused pleads guilty, whether he is or not, and saves the state the trouble of a trial in return for the promise of a less severe punishment.”</p>

<h2 id="hofstadter-and-the-capitalistic-boundaries-of-us-politics">Hofstadter and the capitalistic boundaries of US politics</h2>

<p>Halfway through the twentieth century, the historian Richard Hofstadter, in his book The American Political Tradition, examined our important national leaders, from Jefferson and
Jackson to Herbert Hoover and the two Roosevelts – Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives. Hofstadter concluded that “<strong>the range of vision embraced by the primary
contestants in the major parties has always been bounded by the horizons of property and enterprise.</strong> […] They have accepted the economic virtues of capitalist culture as necessary qualities of man. […] That culture has been intensely nationalistic […].”</p>

<h2 id="inequalities-in-the-us-and-the-political-system">Inequalities in the US and the political system}</h2>

<p>Clearly, there was something amiss with a political system, supposed to be democratic, in
which the desires of the voters were repeatedly ignored. They could be ignored with impunity
so long as the political system was dominated by two parties, both tied to corporate wealth.
An electorate forced to choose between Carter and Reagan, or Reagan and Mondale, or Bush
and Dukakis could only despair (or decide not to vote) because <strong>neither candidate was capable of dealing with a fundamental economic illness whose roots were deeper than any single presidency</strong>.</p>

<p>That illness came from a fact which was almost never talked about: that the United States
was a class society, in which 1 percent of the population owned 33 percent of the wealth, with
an underclass of 30 to 40 million people living in poverty. The social programs of the sixties  – 
Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps, etc. – did not do much more than maintain the historic American maldistribution of resources.</p>

<h2 id="swords-and-plowshares">Swords and plowshares</h2>

<p>Reagan’s policies clearly joined the two issues of disarmament and social welfare. It was
guns versus children, and this was expressed dramatically by the head of the Children’s
Defense Fund, Marian Wright Edelman, in a commencement speech at the Milton Academy
in Massachusetts in the summer of 1983:</p>

<p>“You are graduating into a nation and world teetering on the brink of moral and economic
bankruptcy. Since 1980, our President and Congress have been turning our national
plowshares into swords<label for="sn-id-bible" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-id-bible" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote"><em>Many peoples shall come and say, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths.” For out of Zion shall go forth instruction, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. He shall judge between the nations, and shall arbitrate for many peoples; they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</em> – Isaiah 2:3-4 </span> and been bringing good news to the rich at the expense of the poor […]. Children are the major victims. Our misguided national and world choices are literally
killing children daily […]. Yet governments throughout the world, led by our own, spend over 600 billion a year on arms, while an estimated 1 billion of our world’s people live in poverty and 600 million are under- or unemployed. Where is the human commitment and political will to find the relative pittance of money needed to protect children?”</p>

<p>She urged her listeners: “<strong>Pick a piece of the problem that you can help solve while trying to
see how your piece fits into the broader social change puzzle.</strong>”</p>

<h2 id="gulf-war-and-the-smart-bombs">Gulf War and the smart bombs</h2>

<p>In fact, the public was being deceived about how “smart” the bombs being dropped on Iraqi towns were. After talking with former intelligence and Air Force officers, a correspondent for the Boston Globe reported that perhaps 40 percent of the laser-guided bombs dropped in Operation Desert Storm missed their targets.</p>

<p>John Lehman, Secretary of the Navy under President Reagan, estimated there had been thousands of civilian casualties. The Pentagon officially had no figure on this. A senior Pentagon official told the Globe, “To tell you the truth, we’re not really focusing on this question.”</p>

<h2 id="the-peace-dividend">The peace dividend</h2>

<p>After the disintegration of the Soviet bloc began in 1989, there had been talk
in the United States of a “peace dividend,” the opportunity to take billions of dollars from the
military budget and use it for human needs. The war in the Gulf became a convenient excuse
for the government determined to stop such talk. A member of the Bush administration said:
“We owe Saddam a favor. He saved us from the peace dividend” (New York Times, March 2,
1991).</p>

<h2 id="iraq-embargo">Iraq embargo</h2>

<p>In an even more flagrant violation of the principle of free trade, the United States would not allow shipments of food or medicine to Iraq or to Cuba, the result being the death of tens of thousands of children. In 1996, on the television program <em>60 minutes</em>, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Madeleine Albright was asked about the report that “a half million children have died as a result of sanctions against Iraq […]. That is more children than died in Hiroshima […]. Is the price worth it? Albright replied: “I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.”</p>

<h2 id="clinton-and-the-arm-industry">Clinton and the arm industry</h2>

<p>The United States continued to supply lethal arms to some of the most vicious regimes in the
world. Indonesia had a record of mass murder, having killed perhaps 200,000 out of a
population of 700,000 in its invasion and occupation of East Timor. Yet the Clinton
administration approved the sale of F-16 fighter planes and other assault equipment to
Indonesia. The Boston Globe wrote (July 11, 1994):</p>

<p>“The arguments presented by senators solicitous of Suharto’s regime-and of defense
contractors, oil companies and mining concerns doing business with Jakarta-made
Americans seem a people willing to overlook genocide for the sake of commerce.”</p>
